This project took my first project and updated it into a multi-page React app.  It features a website that I can use for my current business as a tattoo artist.  It tells a story and then allows clients to learn a little bit about me, look at my art, request an appointment, learn how to take care of their new tattoo and play on an interactive puzzle that uses a piece of my art.  This was a fun project and I hope you enjoy it.
